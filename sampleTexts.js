					+ "if I told anything pretty personal about them. They're quite touchy about anything like  "
					+ "that, especially my father. They're nice and all--I'm not saying that--but they're also  "
					+ "touchy as hell. Besides, I'm not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or  "

					+ "Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out here and take it easy. I  "
					+ "mean that's all I told D.B. about, and he's my brother and all. He's in Hollywood. That  "
					+ "isn't too far from this crumby place, and he comes over and visits me practically every  "
					+ "week end. He's going to drive me home when I go home next month maybe. He just got a  "
					+ "Jaguar. One of those little English jobs that can do around two hundred miles an hour. It "
					+ "cost him damn near four thousand bucks. He's got a lot of dough, now. He didn't use to.  "
					+ "He used to be just a regular writer, when he was home. He wrote this terrific book of  "
					+ "short stories, The Secret Goldfish, in case you never heard of him. The best one in it was " + "\"The Secret Goldfish.\" It was about this "
					+ "little kid that wouldn't let anybody look at his " + "goldfish because he'd bought it with his own money. It killed me. Now he's out in "
					+ "Hollywood, D.B., being a prostitute. If there's one thing I hate, it's the movies. Don't even " + "mention them to me. "
